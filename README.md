# Cross-Chain Transaction Optimization Agent

## Project Overview
This project is a Cross-Chain Transaction Optimization Agent inspired by Automated Market Makers (AMMs), particularly Constant Product Market Makers (CPMMs), and liquidity aggregation solutions like Euclid. The agent aims to minimize slippage, reduce transaction costs, and optimize liquidity usage across multiple blockchain networks.

## Features
- **Liquidity Aggregation:** Aggregates liquidity from multiple pools across various blockchains.
- **Smart Routing:** Routes transactions through pools with the best price and lowest slippage.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Enables token swaps and liquidity aggregation across multiple blockchain networks.
- **Dynamic Slippage Reduction:** Uses advanced algorithms to reduce slippage and price impact.
- **Real-Time Data Monitoring:** Continuously updates pricing and liquidity information.

## How It Works
1. **Data Aggregation:** Fetches liquidity and token reserve data from multiple liquidity pools across different chains.
2. **Unified Liquidity Calculation:** Combines liquidity pools to form a unified pool for each token pair.
3. **Optimal Routing:** Calculates the best transaction route to minimize slippage.
4. **Cross-Chain Execution:** Utilizes cross-chain bridge protocols to facilitate swaps across different blockchains.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Solidity (for smart contract development)
- Python (for off-chain data aggregation and routing logic)
- Blockchain APIs for fetching liquidity data

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pro-utkarshM/ChainOptium.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure blockchain API keys and cross-chain bridge details in the `.env` file.

### Running the Project
1. Start the local blockchain environment:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```
2. Deploy the smart contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```
3. Run the optimization agent:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven predictive optimization
- Integration with additional cross-chain bridge protocols
- Multi-token support for complex transactions
